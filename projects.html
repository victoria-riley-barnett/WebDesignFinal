        <h3>My Flask blog</h3>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p><a href="https://project-riley.herokuapp.com/index">My other website</a>, developed for a final exam for a class, this is a Blog that uses Flask - a popular Python web application framework. Working with Flask has been my preffered way of dipping my toes into web applications, because I am much more comfortable with Python than Javascript at the moment, so I currently prefer flask over something like Vue or React, though I'm sure I'd like to learn those eventually. I plan to continue to post to the blog in order to expand it's content, and also want to upgrade it's domain name and hosting solution soon - it is currently located at project-riley.herokuapp.com as a test deployment to ensure things are working correctly.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>My Portfolio Site (this site!)</h3>
        <p>Unlike the blog application, I would like for this site to serve as a central hub for my professional online identity! It will include links to further profiles, be used as a test area to show off any new web development skills or tools, and serve as a place to list all of my professional technical skills, classes and the projects I do in them, and also my resume. I felt it wise to develop seperate sites and not run an opinions blog on my portfolio site - so the seperate portfolio site works for best for me.</p>

        <h2>Various Python Exercises</h2>
        <p>As mentioned when discussing Flask, I am much more comfortable with Python than with other programming languages, thanks to it being the first language I ever tried to self-learn way back in 2014 - and I've been dabbling into it ever since during my years in the military and now while in school. Here are some of the various Python exercises I've completed so far for my Python class - I hope to expand this section with even more complex projects later.</p>
